version 2.0.0

  o update KEGG and GO gene sets to the latest definitions. Changed the
    gene set data object names from kegg.xx to kegg.sets.xx, and from
    go.xx to go.sets.xx.

  o add subsetting indices kegg.sigmet.xx and go.subs.xx for more
    refined gene set or pathway analysis.

  o add gse16873.affyid, which is similar to gse16873 in gage package,
    except that row IDs are Affymetrix probe set IDs instead of Entrez
    Gene IDs.
